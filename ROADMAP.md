# ROADMAP

This is a preliminary roadmap that could evolve frequently according to requirements.

## v0.2

- Read Day files from OSCAR structure
- Implement a Pytorch DataLoader

## Future releases (do not know the order)

- Read all OSCAR profile structure
- Save/read sessions to/from edf/hdf format.
- (long term) Use C++ Oscar source code with python binding to read session files. Needs OSCAR to be refactored.
